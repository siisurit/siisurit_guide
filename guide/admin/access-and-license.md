# Access and license

To download the most current version of Siisurit, you need access to its Docker registry at https://docker-registry-ui.siisurit.com/.

In order to run Siisurit as a service, you need a license key.

**Siisurit is currently in closed beta**. You can request access by sending an email to support@siisurit with the following information:

- The heading "Closed beta request"
- The name, address, and VAT ID of your company
- The number projects you think Siisurit could help you with
- Your task tracker(s), for example: GitHub, Jira, Trello, YouTrack, ...
- Your time tracker(s), for example: clockodo, GitLab, Kimai, toggl track,
- The expected number of tasks (sometimes called "issues" or "tickets") of your largest project
- The expected number of projects members working on your largest project

We will get back to you, and - if your combination adds something new to the current list of beta testers - provide you with a beta access license key.
