# estimate_task

Estimate a given task based on the work it took to implement similar tasks in other projects. For this to work, [update_search](update_search.md) must have been called recently.

!!! warning "Experimental"

    This command is still very experimental and at the moment typically delivers less than useful results.

To be done, for now use `--help`.

## Examples

To

```
python manage.py estimate_task "#123" demo-inc
```
