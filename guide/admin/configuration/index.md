# Overview

To configure you instance, multiple files are available to deal with different aspects of the configuration. This helps to limit access of sensitive details like passwords and API tokens to only a selected few people, while other aspects like project configuration can be done by others like project admins.

These files are:

- [Environment file](environment-file.md)
- [User list](user-list.md)
- [Organization configuration](../../user/organization-configuration.md)
- [Compose file](compose-file.md)

Alternatively, a site admin can create or fine tune the configuration in the admin site, which can be accessed by opening the backend URL in the browser.
